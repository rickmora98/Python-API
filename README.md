# python-api-challenge 

This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment #6.

### Code Files:

> **WeatherPy.ipynb** - gets and analyses weather for random cities around the world<br>
> **VacationPy.ipynb** - uses the weather data from "WeatherPy" to map hotels in favorable locations<br>

### Folders:

> **output_data** - contains csv files and graphic files output from "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy"

### Note:

* "WeatherPy" must be run first before running "VacationPy" as it must create a csv file that is needed by "VacationPy".
* Both "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy" have blocks of code that take a few minutes to complete.
