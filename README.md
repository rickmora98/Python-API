<h1> WeatherPy and VacationPy <br> (Two Examples of Using API Calls in Python) </h1>

#### Overview: 

#### Files/Folders:

+ **"Code"** (folder containing code files and output) <br>
  - **"output_data"**  (folder containing csv files and graphic files output from "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy") <br>
  - *"api_keys.py"* (you will need to create this file to contain your API keys for OpenWeather and Google Maps) <br>
  - *"WeatherPy.ipynb"* (gets and analyzes weather for random cities around the world) <br>
  - *"VacationPy.ipynb"* (uses the weather data from "WeatherPy" to map hotels in favorable locations) <br>

(Please do not delete, move, rename, or alter!)

#### Note:

> "WeatherPy" must be run first before running "VacationPy" as it must create a csv file that is needed by "VacationPy". <br>
> Both "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy" have blocks of code that take a few minutes to complete. <br>
> You will need to put your API keys from OpenWeather and Google Maps into a file named **api_keys.py** in this directory. <br>
